          <h2>Quezon City</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            Despite being a bustling urban center, Quezon City retains pockets of agricultural areas that contribute to local food production and green spaces within the city. Its agricultural landscape, though relatively limited due to urbanization, showcases efforts to promote urban farming and sustainability initiatives, reflecting the city's commitment to fostering green spaces and community agriculture.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Urban Farming Initiatives : </b>Quezon City promotes urban farming through community gardens, rooftop gardening, and vertical farming initiatives. These projects encourage residents to grow vegetables, herbs, and fruits in limited spaces, promoting self-sustainability and local produce.</li>
            <li><b>Community-Based Agriculture : </b>Various barangays (neighborhoods) in Quezon City have community-based agricultural programs that engage residents in cultivating small plots of land for growing crops, fostering a sense of community and food security.</li>
            <li><b>School and Institutional Gardens : </b>Schools and institutions in Quezon City often have gardens or green spaces where students and staff participate in gardening activities. These gardens serve as educational tools and promote awareness of agriculture and environmental conservation.</li>
            <li><b>Green Spaces and Parks : </b>While not purely agricultural, Quezon City's green spaces and parks contribute to the preservation of greenery within the urban landscape. These areas offer recreational spaces while also supporting some forms of vegetation and landscaping.</li>
            <li><b>Agro-Tourism : </b>Some parts of Quezon City, particularly those on the outskirts, offer agro-tourism activities. Farms and gardens open their doors to visitors, providing tours, workshops, and experiences related to agriculture, educating people about farming practices and rural life.</li>
            <li><b>Efforts for Sustainability : </b>The local government and various organizations in Quezon City undertake initiatives to promote sustainable agricultural practices. This includes composting programs, water conservation measures, and the use of organic farming techniques where feasible./li>
            <li><b>Challenges and Opportunities : </b>Urbanization poses challenges to agriculture in Quezon City, leading to limited space for farming activities.
